        <p>Jollof rice is a dish with deep roots in West African culture,
             and it’s one that carries with it a sense of community, celebration, and tradition. In my household, this recipe

             jollof rice brings with it the memories of family gatherings and festive occasions, but it’s also a comfort

             <p> Nigerian jollof rice is simple, yet packed with flavour. 
                It’s made with basmati rice, which is lighter and fluffier than other types of rice often 
                used in jollof, and it always includes DeRica tomato paste—a brand that has been a kitchen 
                mainstay for as long as I can remember. Whether you’re new to jollof rice or just looking to 
                refine your technique, this recipe will guide you through the process with ease. You can

        <h1>The Secret to a Good Jollof Rice Base</h1>
        <p>The key to making Nigerian jollof rice that’s full of flavour starts
             with a proper base. My mum’s recipe calls for blending red bell pepper, 
             vine tomatoes, red onion, scotch bonnets, garlic, and ginger into a smooth purée.
              This base is the foundation of your jollof rice and it’s what gives it that iconic red hue and flavour.</p>
              <p>One of the things I love about this step is the balance of flavours that develops
                 from the combination of ingredients. The red bell peppers bring sweetness, 
                 while the tomatoes offer acidity and richness. Scotch bonnets introduce a fiery heat,
                  though this can be easily adjusted based on your tolerance. And then there’s the ginger,
                   which adds a zingy freshness that cuts through the richness of the tomato purée.</p>
                   <p>Cooking this base down until it’s thick and flavourful is crucial. 
                    You’ll want to cook the blended mixture until it reduces by about a third, 
                    which intensifies the flavours. It’s during this stage that the oil will begin to separate 
                    from the sauce—a key indicator that you’re on the right track.</p>
